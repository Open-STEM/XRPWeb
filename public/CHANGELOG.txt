* Under the RUN button will be the unique name of the XRP. You will want to write this on the XRP.
* Disconnect the XRP from the cable and turn on the XRP.
* When you click CONNECT select Bluetooth and it will bring up a list of XRPs that are not currently connected. (If your XRP does not show up press reset)
* Select your XRP and click Pair.
* Once connected XRPCode should be the same as if connected via a cable. YOU ARE NOW CABLE FREE!
* If the XRP is reset / turned off / too far away XRPCode will show RE-CONNECT XRP for 10 seconds and then switch to CONNECT.
    * If the XRP is turned back on / brought closer XRPCode will auto re-connect to the XRP within that 10 seconds
* If you start the XRP and a program runs keeping the bluetooth from connecting then press reset and it will restart without running the program
